Description for Phyco-Skiing
My project is called Phyco-skiing, which is a skiing game with all motions Physics simulated. Before start, players can choose the setting, difficulty level, as well as inputting their mass. The goal is to finish the course as fast as possible, and if the player cannot finish in 15 seconds, the game is lost. The race course is broken down into several sections, representing different math functions. Throughout the game, the player (represented by a ball) is subject to gravity, friction, the shape of the curve, and would also be influenced by barriers as well as helpers. As a major barrier, bears will appear randomly on the curve, and its size is determined by their randomly generated mass. When the player collides with the bear, its velocity would change (decrease) and the dragging starts. Each bear can only drag for a certain period of time, and after that, it will free-fall off the screen. A regular bear, a dragging bear, and a falling bear has different picture which could be easily told. Skateboard which can knock bears away will appear at random positions, free falling from top to bottom. (Only one will be on the screen at one time). User can drag the skateboard to the player (if on board, the player will become green with a larger size) or move them with by pressing left or right arrows, and once it gets on board, it will be able to move fast without being dragged by bear. The player can only be on board for a short period, after that the skateboard will also fall off. After each finish, user can check history, which keeps track of their PR (personal record). 


How to Use
